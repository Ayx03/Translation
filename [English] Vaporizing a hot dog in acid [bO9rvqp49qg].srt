00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,800
Okay so today, I've decided to dissolve my wiener 
in acid. I'm not just going to be using any acid  

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,880
though, and I'm going to be using something 
special, called piranha solution. It's a hot  

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,960
and angry mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen 
peroxide, and I basically just have to drop it in.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,760
It almost immediately turns black, and this 
is all carbon. Now if I add some more peroxide  

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,600
I can vaporize the carbon, 
and turn it into CO2 gas.  

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,120
I think it's pretty obvious, but I'm still gonna 
mention, that this is extremely dangerous. If any  

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:57,840
of this splashed on me, it would do something 
very similar, which wouldn't be super pleasant.

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,800
It eventually looked like there was barely any of 
it left, and it was just a sad little meat noodle.  

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:16,800
Then over the next 30 seconds or so, it calmed 
down, and it was ready for another wiener.
