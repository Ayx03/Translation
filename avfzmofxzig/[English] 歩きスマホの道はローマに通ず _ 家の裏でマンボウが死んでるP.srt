1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,900
"GUILTY!!" You broke the "Anti-Phone-Zombies Act".

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:10,280
You should not lightly cross the line.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,920
I sentence you for transformation into a turtle and for exile. 
("JUSTICE BEAM")

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,940
The only condition you could come back is to "learn".

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,520
All Phone Zombies Lead to Rome / manbo-p

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,940
When I was sobbing on an unknown beach,

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,540
a king secured me for peace.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,040
However, he was taken everything by his people and he was exiled from the land.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,700
I was in ancient Rome, the beginning of the Roman Republic.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,240
However, in fact, aristocrats(the senate) dominated the power.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,800
Commoners were regarded less than old grasshoppers.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,020
Aristocrats gave delicious foods while commoners fed only mud.

14
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,660
Including disparity in the society, they continued extending the war.

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,300
During the war, farms were worn-out and proletarians were increased.

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,880
On the other hand, wealth people earned more by using slaves.

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,000
Aristocrats even fed me money itself.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,540
Commoners tried to hunt me to cook sashimi.

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,060
"Sulla: the Optimates" VS "Marius: the Populares"

20
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,080
"The War of Spartacus". We're entering civil wars.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,840
I was sent to the war zone for being a shell-shield.

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
"Don't make me a true zombie!! Don't kill Me!" 

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,140
Caesar, Pompeius, and Crassus!

24
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,260
Populares were ruling Rome and the 1st Triumviratus began.

25
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,820
Now get relieved? Remember guys,

26
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,120
this is the (inevitable) consequence of Phone-Zombies.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,280
Crassus's gone like easy money. 

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,380
Pompeius went over to the senate. WHY.
(Pompeius:"He’s so cocky." Senators:"Yeah, I know" )

29
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,040
Caesar punished him, but he was assassinated by Brute. 
("Et tu, Brute?")

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,780
The scar on my shell(Drooling Donkey) would never heal.  

31
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,080
Antonius, Lepidus, and Octavianus.

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,140
The 2nd Triumviratus began, damply.

33
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,220
Lepidus's gone like easy money. 

34
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,880
The new conflict began among those two left.
Am I watching a recording?

35
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,720
Octavianus(adopted child of Caesar) followed his father's footsteps.

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,920
Antonius, teamed up with Cleopatra, stood against him.

37
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,520
In the Battle of Actium,

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,960
I worked for Octavianus and brought him victory.

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,460
He started Principate,

40
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,680
which well-balanced with the power of the senate.

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,740
It was totally different from what happened in Caesar's.
("Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus", "Puddingceps", "Pater Patriae")

42
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,940
I've witnessed how people progressed

43
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,400
by "learning" from the past.

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,020
Although being a turtle is fine, it's a really peaceful life

45
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,200
Thanks to the Five Good Emperors, it was Pax Romana.
("Nerva","Trajan","Hadrian,"Antoninus Pius","Marcus Aurelius")

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,900
With water supply and public baths, it's very comfortable

47
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,140
Maybe I could have been born as a turtle

48
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,440
However, Rome became too large.

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,640
Caracalla expanded citizenship in provinces,

50
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,140
which led to the flood of Barracks emperors.

51
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,500
人は争いを繰り返す
"Conflicts between people are repeated.
(Diocletian, Constantine, Theodosius)"

52
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,860
Diocletian advertises himself as God.
("Diocletianus", "I am THE GOD")

53
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,760
Constantinus approved Christianity.
("Remember. Athanasius is the Orthodox Church"
 
0:03:33.760,0:03:37.540
They aimed unification in their ways, 
but only ended up triggering another fight.

54
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,760
デオトシウスは死の淵で苦しみを打ち明けた
Theodosius confessed his suffering at his last moment.

55
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,780
"We were looking for a way to bring peace to everyone.

56
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,900
We were looking for a way to let people help each other.
Now, we ARE still do it.

57
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,100
We human do not have a shell

58
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,060
so we need somebody to leave our back."

59
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,380
"I hope we'll find the way after me"

60
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,580
The wish was never come true.

61
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,480
The Roman Empire fell. Divided by East and West. 

62
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,520
I finally understood.

63
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,980
The world is build on people in the past,

64
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,100
who fought each other, acknowledged each other,

65
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,240
and failed again and again.

66
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,740
And I understood we're still halfway.

67
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,700
I, who "learned" it, came back to where I was.

68
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,320
The world looks slightly different.

69
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,900
I know because I've changed.
