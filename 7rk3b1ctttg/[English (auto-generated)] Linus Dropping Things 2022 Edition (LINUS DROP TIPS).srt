[Laughter]

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,759
four m.2 pcie Jen at least four parts on

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,039
this thing we're going with the 12 900k

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,080
because the

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,359
don't worry I caught it with the foot

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,699
because the chaos

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,340
the chaos wasn't out yet how do you like

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,080
the case it's awesome I know right

11
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,180
do you know how to hold a steam bag

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,180
okay this is Jake's phone actually so

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,380
I'm not going to check his text but

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,300
maybe maybe Jake Hey Jake are you an

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,660
earshot or like I can text him whoa

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,860
Colin tell me a little story

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,520
all right all right that's enough of

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,559
that story this was actually last week

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,239
but we missed it and that was not

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,719
intense

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,460
that's not a word that wasn't

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,160
intentional either it's not a word

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,720
low-key hock my phone at my laptop

24
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,020
and that was not intention

25
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,439
so when they saw a gigabyte release look

26
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,840
look at him he's all sweaty he's all

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,360
stressed out I am the opposite of stress

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,720
right now

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,240
just put it down it was a very short

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,080
distance drop

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm trying to put it down

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,759
God damn it We don't even know how much

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,640
this costs it's probably like 70 grand

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,540
?

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,360
oh there goes my lunch how about now

36
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,780
it's a little heavy, a little clumsy you

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,540
might say okay but

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,759
this is the moment where you are second

39
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,619
most likely to bung up your computer

40
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,079
okay see these little standoffs in here

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,340
let's show let's show all the

42
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,459
you did a great job of applying those

43
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,258
stickers but they made it a little heavy

44
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,599
they're a little front heavy now so they

45
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,060
fell right

46
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,700
oh ho ho ho ho ho oh ho ho ho ho ho

47
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,020
my goodness

48
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,060
you gotta do something

49
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,580
a little special I don't think I'm gonna

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,200
let you pick this one up

51
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,060
ready one two three I can't believe

52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,680

oh God oh God

54
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,760
NVMe like you see here these are

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,660
gonna be spicy and then around back

56
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,940
so that's where a ton of our air intake

57
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,760
is going to come from but just that not

58
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,800
gonna be enough for the there goes my

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,800
back panel I appear to have experienced

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,260
some shipping damage three two I'm

61
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,959

66
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,519

do you think it still works no

77
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,900
did you hear the noise in me well it's a

78
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,680
pretty

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,860
night still at work

80
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,140
okay lunch says it still works I think

81
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,940
that drive will die faster than the

82
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,640
other ones okay that's nice but that

83
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,799
wasn't the bet

84
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,140
I'll buy you lunch whatever yes

85
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,920
and safely and

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,220
we are off to a really really good start

87
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,099
here as an Infamous Butterfingers I have

88
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,019
dropped my fair share of phones I

89
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,420
present exhibit a my iPhone 6 that

90
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,519
regrettably succumbed to that most cruel

91
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,478
of Mistresses gravity on both front and

92
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,279
back has an included screen protector

93
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,320
and that did come in handy I actually

94
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,360
dropped it on the pavement

95
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,699
like an hour before we filmed this it

96
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,040
was in pristine condition

97
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,220
but it handled it like a champ all it

98
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,080
did was Dent the aluminum frame a little

99
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,720
bit I've certainly had worse

100
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,520
watching the stupid way that I'm gonna

101
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,960
do things he's like no no really There's

102
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,940
A Better Way Linus it's like dude I know

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,160

GPU power if you wanted like an a100 or

127
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,419

00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,819
trying to feel out his opponent oh

153
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,620
there you go

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,890
hmm

155
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,520
[Applause]

156
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,220
fantastic 20 minutes not too bad

157
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,819
20 minutes what a blue screened shut up

158
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,960
I didn't do anything

159
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,099
no I don't have an aura

160
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,500
what the was that that's the center

161
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,000
piece of the screen okay it's only a

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,880
little bent of both our PC and our

163
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,800
Monitor and

164
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,599
what you'll be accustomed to if you use

165
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,580
whoa hi

166
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,500
so it's almost impossible to get

167
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,280
everything you know matching under

168
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,080
all conditions well I guess we

169
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,080
inadvertently are going to check and see

170
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,300
oh yeah how durable it is if you happen

171
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,280
to drop your PlayStation or something

172
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,160
I've actually done this before so don't

173
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,699
freak out

174
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,220
it's a werewolf Thing Once I bite them

175
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,080
they start dropping things

176
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,599
okay

177
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,380

oh I'm glad it wasn't me

181
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,460

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,500
by heart yeah you did you did I would

183
