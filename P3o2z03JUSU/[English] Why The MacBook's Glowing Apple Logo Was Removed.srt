00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,190
Back in 2015, Apple introduced the 12-inch
MacBook.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,109
The first model ever to feature an Apple logo
that didn’t light up.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:13,340
And since then, the MacBook Pro and MacBook
Air have also received the same treatment.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,900
This caused some controversy, since the glowing
Apple logo has been around for over two decades

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,810
and has become an iconic design element of
Apple’s notebooks.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,240
So why was the illuminated Apple logo removed?

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,940
Well, that’s exactly what I’ll explain
right now.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,480
So when the 12-inch MacBook was introduced,
it was the thinnest model in Apple’s history.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,840
In fact, at 13.1 millimeters, it was 24% thinner
than the MacBook Air.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,570
But that dramatic improvement didn’t come
without compromises.

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:49,160
For example, Apple had to create a new super-thin
keyboard that featured butterfly mechanisms

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,510
instead of the traditional scissor design.

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,261
They claimed the new keyboard was an improvement,
but that didn’t turn out to be the case.

14
00:00:56,261 --> 00:01:01,410
It was extremely faulty and resulted in a
class action lawsuit, with Apple eventually

15
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,069
reverting back to the scissor keyboards.

16
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:09,280
But another compromise of the 12-inch MacBook
was the non-illuminated Apple logo.

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,530
Since the display was so thin, two problems
arose.

18
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,220
First, if there was a strong light source
behind the display, you could actually see

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,229
a subtle hotspot in the center of the screen.

20
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:25,010
Since the glowing Apple logo was a transparent
cutout that allowed the display’s backlight

21
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,640
to shine through, but also allowed external
light to enter.

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,659
This meant using the MacBook outside could
cause color inaccuracies on the display.

23
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:40,409
So to eliminate this potential issue, Apple
had to seal off the display’s chassis entirely,

24
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,170
which meant getting rid of the translucent
logo.

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,030
But there was another benefit to this approach,
the thinness of the MacBook’s display combined

26
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,409
with the Apple logo cutout, caused structural
rigidity issues.

27
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,350
Just like the iPad Pro was easily bent thanks
to the Apple Pencil attachment cutout, the

28
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,490
MacBook could’ve easily been bent due to
the Apple logo cutout.

29
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:07,050
So replacing its weak spot with a piece of
metal, helped eliminate this structural weakness.

30
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:12,230
The third reason why Apple got rid of their
glowing logo is for purely aesthetic reasons.

31
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:18,469
Back when the trend started in 1999 with the
PowerBook G3, Apple was mounting a comeback.

32
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:23,250
Steve Jobs had just returned to the company
three years prior, and he put a huge focus

33
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,180
on establishing a new reputation for Apple.

34
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,469
Since they’d fallen out of favor with customers
over the past decade.

35
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:34,549
That’s what sparked the Think Different
ad campaign, and radical new computer designs

36
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:36,079
like the iMac and PowerBook.

37
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:41,379
It was the first time a glowing Apple logo
had been used, and it was crucial in creating

38
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,840
brand awareness.

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,419
Seeing a prominently displayed Apple logo
in public reminded people that the company

40
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:51,450
was still around, and was actually creating
some really cool products.

41
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,109
But today, Apple has been moving away from
this overt brand strategy and shifting to

42
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,349
something more subtle.

43
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:02,559
For example, they could’ve put an Apple
logo on the AirPods Max, like almost every

44
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:05,249
other headphone manufacturer, but they didn’t.

45
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:10,410
Also, with the 24-inch iMac, Apple removed
their logo from the product’s chin for the

46
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,090
first time since 2004.

47
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,529
And it makes sense why they don’t need their
logo to be as overtly display anymore.

48
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:21,739
Apple isn’t struggling to garner attention
or win customers from other brands.

49
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:26,529
They’re by far the biggest and most recognizable
tech company in the world.

50
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:30,579
With almost every product they create dominating
their respective market.

51
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,209
Apple has also been unifying their product
design in recent years.

52
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:40,420
And since the iPad, iPhone, and Mac desktops
all have non-illuminated Apple logos, it makes

53
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,439
sense to carry that design language through
to the MacBook line.

54
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,989
So while it’s understandable to feel sentimental
about losing the glowing Apple logo, it can

55
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:50,980
also spark some excitement.

56
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,510
Since it represents a new era of Apple, with
plenty of incredible products yet to come.

57
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,160
This is Greg from Apple Explained, thanks
