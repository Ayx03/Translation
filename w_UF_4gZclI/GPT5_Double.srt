1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:05,960
This is Minecraft, the game that screwed its community so hard that we're about to sue them in a class action lawsuit.

2
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:05,960
这是《Minecraft》，这款游戏把它的社区坑得如此之惨，以至于我们即将对他们发起集体诉讼。

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,159
You see, in December of 2024, I uploaded this video in which I exposed Mojang

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,159
你看，在 2024 年 12 月，我上传了这段视频，在其中我揭露了 Mojang

5
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:14,299
the creators of Minecraft, for breaking consumer protection law and exposing children to gambling.

6
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:14,299
也就是《Minecraft》的开发者，违反了消费者保护法，并让儿童接触到赌博。

7
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:16,119
And while I tried to seek justice for myself

8
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:16,119
而当我试图为自己寻求公正时

9
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,059
I wasn't able to do so because my government is kind of incompetent

10
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,059
我没能做到，因为我的政府有点无能

11
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,699
making access to justice basically impossible if you're not rich as fuck.

12
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,699
如果你不是特别有钱，基本上就不可能获得公正。

13
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,180
So I tried adding a GoFundMe campaign at the end to finance a class action lawsuit

14
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,180
所以我尝试在最后加上一个 GoFundMe 筹款活动，用来资助一场集体诉讼

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,279
because this wasn't something that affected just me.

16
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,279
因为这并不是只影响到我一个人的事情。

17
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,979
And obviously, there's no way that would actually work

18
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,979
而且显然，这根本不可能真的奏效

19
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:32,399
right?

20
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:32,399
对吧？

21
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,099
YouTuber Kiabru- Is suing Mojang.

22
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,099
YouTuber Kiabru——正在起诉 Mojang。

23
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:37,719
Illegally changing- They publicly funded- It's already nearly on a million Gs.

24
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:37,719
非法更改——他们是公开筹资的——已经接近一百万美元了。

25
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,599
19 on trending right now.

26
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,599
目前在趋势榜上排名第 19。

27
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:39,060
It's exceeded it.

28
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:39,060
它已经超越了。

29
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,779
Completed its funding.

30
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,779
已完成融资。

31
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:41,680
Already passed- $120,000.

32
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:41,680
已经超过——12 万美元。

33
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,520
That's a lot.

34
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,520
真多啊。

35
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
No way the class- Dude, look at this.

36
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
不可能是班级——哥们，看看这个。

37
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,759
That's gotta be one of the fastest-growing crowdfunding campaigns.

38
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,759
这一定是增长最快的众筹活动之一。

39
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,559
We raised $150,000 within days.

40
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,559
我们在几天内就筹集了 15 万美元。

41
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,899
Oh, it's fucking happening.

42
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,899
哦，这他妈的真的要成了。

43
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:54,939
Where we now have access to legal representation and can proceed with the class action lawsuit.

44
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:54,939
我们现在可以获得法律代理，并可以继续进行集体诉讼。

45
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:55,200
Yes.

46
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:55,200
是的。

47
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,340
My name is Bjorn Persson.

48
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,340
我叫 Bjorn Persson。

49
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,939
I'm a member of the Swedish Borrower Association.

50
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,939
我是瑞典借款人协会的成员。

51
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,939
I run a law firm together with my colleague

52
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,939
我和我的同事一起经营一家律师事务所

53
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:00,739
Conny Larsson.

54
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:00,739
Conny Larsson。

55
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,578
And we're working with this lawsuit since it's part of our practice and are looking to

56
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,578
我们正在处理这起诉讼，因为它是我们业务的一部分，并且我们希望

57
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:10,939
um, run this, uh, lawsuit as a class action against Mojang because we think it's an important issue that needs to be addressed.

58
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:10,939
嗯，将这起诉讼作为针对 Mojang 的集体诉讼来进行，因为我们认为这是一个需要解决的重要问题。

59
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:16,699
To give you a little recap, Minecraft is one of those games that anyone can modify to add things that it didn't originally have.

60
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:16,699
简单回顾一下，Minecraft 是那种任何人都可以修改、添加原本没有的内容的游戏之一。

61
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:23,639
And what I wanted to do was add guns to the game to recreate an old game that I used to play as a child that had unfortunately been shut down.

62
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:23,639
我想做的是在游戏中加入枪支，以重现我小时候玩过的一款老游戏，但那款游戏不幸已经停运了。

63
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:25,299
But right as it was about to release

64
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:25,299
但就在它即将发布的时候

65
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:31,327
Mojang said that, "A recent directive from Mojang leadership determined that guns and weapons were considered non-compliant features.

66
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:31,327
Mojang 表示：“Mojang 高层最近的指令认定，枪支和武器被视为不合规的功能。”

67
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,059
" Meaning that they had to be completely removed

68
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,059
这意味着它们必须被彻底移除

69
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,959
implying the shutdown of dozens of projects, including mine.

70
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,959
这暗示着包括我的项目在内的数十个项目被关闭。

71
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:41,399
But when actually looking into it, even though they said that guns and weapons were specifically prohibited by the game's legal agreement

72
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:41,399
但当真正去调查时，尽管他们说游戏的法律协议中明确禁止枪支和武器

73
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:46,579
when actually looking for these specific prohibitions, you'd come to find that they didn't actually exist.

74
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:46,579
当你真正去寻找这些具体的禁令时，你会发现它们实际上并不存在。

75
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:50,419
So Mojang was making shit up and pretending it was part of the Terms of Service

76
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:50,419
所以 Mojang 只是在胡编乱造，并假装这些是服务条款的一部分

77
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:52,179
a type of contract, which as you've guessed

78
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:52,179
一种合同类型，正如你所猜到的

79
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,259
is kind of illegal.

80
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,259
有点违法。

81
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:58,479
A contract is an agreement between two parties and both parties need to agree what the meaning of the contract is.

82
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:58,479
合同是双方之间的协议，双方都需要就合同的含义达成一致。

83
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,219
You can't be forced into new rules that apply to your contract unless you've been notified

84
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,219
除非你已被告知，否则不能被强制适用合同中的新规则。

85
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:09,519
as well as having a choice whether to actually accept those terms or just be able to keep using what you already have.

86
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:09,519
以及可以选择是否真正接受这些条款，或者只是继续使用你已经拥有的东西。

87
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:14,099
And since this is a hidden clause where guns are just one of the many examples that exist

88
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:14,099
而且由于这是一个隐藏条款，枪支只是其中众多例子之一

89
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,919
Mojang can do whatever they want, like applying a different version of the same clause so you never know which one you're gonna get

90
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,919
Mojang 可以随心所欲，比如应用同一条款的不同版本，这样你永远不知道自己会遇到哪一个版本

91
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,359
changing their minds at any time, like they did with the guns three times

92
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,359
随时改变主意，就像他们在枪支问题上那样，已经改了三次。

93
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:28,679
and even go against their own rules, like allowing gambling even though they publicly pretend like it's forbidden.

94
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:28,679
甚至会违背自己的规则，比如明明公开假装禁止赌博，却依然允许赌博。

95
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,259
But obviously, shit gets worse.

96
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,259
但显然，情况会变得更糟。

97
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,699
Because when a company changes its terms of service

98
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,699
因为当一家公司更改其服务条款时

99
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,599
it's required to notify its users about the changes and get their agreement for it.

100
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,599
它必须通知用户这些更改，并获得用户的同意。

101
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,779
And out of the 47 times they changed their legal agreements

102
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,779
而在他们 47 次更改法律协议的过程中

103
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:41,459
they never told anyone about it.

104
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:41,459
他们从未向任何人提起过这件事。

105
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:48,239
We know this because I went through thousands of archived pages for every single legal agreement that the game has ever had to see if a single word had changed.

106
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:48,239
我们之所以知道这一点，是因为我翻阅了该游戏有史以来的每一份法律协议的数千个存档页面，只为查看是否有哪怕一个字发生了变化。

107
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,199
And Mojang not notifying anyone of changes makes perfect sense

108
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,199
而 Mojang 不通知任何人这些更改是完全说得通的。

109
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,799
since in their own words, "It is up to you to check back to see if these guidelines have changed

110
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,799
因为用他们自己的话来说，“是否查看这些指南是否已更改取决于你自己

111
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,059
" so that it's not their responsibility to tell you.

112
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,059
”，所以这不是他们有责任告诉你的事情。

113
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:03,659
There's a lot of things that you really can't do with the contract and have it enforceable against the consumers.

114
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:03,659
合同中有很多事情你实际上不能做，否则它将无法对消费者产生法律效力。

115
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,359
You have this legislation under European consumer law that

116
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,359
根据欧洲消费者法，你有这样的立法

117
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,759
uh, mandates that the company that changes

118
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,759
呃，规定更改条款的公司

119
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,819
uh, the terms need to inform the consumers about this.

120
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,819
呃，需要将此事告知消费者。

121
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,999
And they can't enforce the, the new changes without giving

122
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,999
而且他们不能在不给

123
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,239
uh, the consumers a choice.

124
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,239
呃，消费者选择的情况下执行这些新变更。

125
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,059
And if not telling anyone wasn't already bad enough- They removed the notice when the software terms were updated.

126
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,059
如果不告知任何人已经不够糟糕的话——他们在软件条款更新时还移除了通知。

127
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:26,779
This is obviously making it harder for the consumers to exercise their rights.

128
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:26,779
这显然让消费者更难行使他们的权利。

129
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:29,899
Because not only is it our responsibility to check when changes happen

130
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:29,899
因为不仅我们有责任去检查何时发生了变化

131
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:33,139
but they also make it borderline impossible to tell when they actually did.

132
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:33,139
而且他们还让我们几乎不可能分辨出这些变化究竟是什么时候发生的。

133
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,659
Which is quite ironic coming from the company that says

134
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,659
这话出自那家公司，真是颇具讽刺意味

135
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,559
"We are trying to be open, honest

136
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,559
“我们努力做到开放、诚实

137
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,457
and most importantly, trusting.

138
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,457
而且最重要的是，值得信任。”

139
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:41,019
" But of course, it only gets worse.

140
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:41,019
但当然，情况只会变得更糟。

141
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:48,259
Remember how the original email from Mojang said that guns were specifically prohibited by these three legal agreements where one of them didn't even exist?

142
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:48,259
还记得 Mojang 的原始邮件是怎么说的吗？他们声称枪支在这三份法律协议中被明确禁止，而其中一份协议甚至根本不存在？

143
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,659
This is something I even pointed out in the last video.

144
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,659
这一点我在上一个视频中就已经指出过了。

145
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:54,159
By the Mojang brand guidelines, guidelines that literally do not exist.

146
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:54,159
根据 Mojang 的品牌指南——实际上并不存在的指南。

147
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:01,019
Well, it turns out that they do exist as its own hidden internal document under a strict NDA that does contain the prohibitions for guns.

148
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:01,019
结果发现，它们确实存在于一份严格保密协议下的内部隐藏文件中，其中确实包含了对枪械的禁止规定。

149
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,439
The very same document where Mojang internally recognizes loot boxes as gambling.

150
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,439
正是在同一份文件中，Mojang 在内部将战利品箱认定为赌博。

151
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:15,339
And what pisses me off even more than them trying to apply a contract that was literally impossible to access without whistleblowers was that while they left us on hold for six months because their CEO was on vacation

152
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:15,339
比起他们试图执行一份如果没有举报人根本无法获取的合同，更让我恼火的是，他们因为 CEO 在度假而让我们被搁置了六个月

153
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,399
they officially partnered with Nerf, the gun company

154
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,399
却正式与玩具枪公司 Nerf 建立了合作关系

155
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,239
even though these guidelines say that gun-like toys are forbidden.

156
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,239
尽管这些指南明确规定禁止类似枪支的玩具。

157
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,339
Fucking hypocrites.

158
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,339
该死的伪君子。

159
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:25,159
But as you probably guessed it, it only gets worse.

160
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:25,159
但正如你可能已经猜到的，情况只会变得更糟。

161
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:29,479
You see, when buying Minecraft, you create a Mojang account that is then used to play the game.

162
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:29,479
你看，当你购买《Minecraft》时，你会创建一个 Mojang 账号，然后用它来玩游戏。

163
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:30,779
At least, that's how it used to be.

164
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:30,779
至少，过去一直是这样的。

165
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:33,839
Because Mojang was bought by Microsoft in 2014

166
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:33,839
因为 Mojang 在 2014 年被微软收购

167
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,399
where just a few years later, Mojang would announce that

168
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,399
而仅仅几年后，Mojang 就会宣布

169
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,979
"We've decided that moving forward, all of our games will require a Microsoft account to play.

170
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,979
我们已决定，从现在开始，我们所有的游戏都将需要使用 Microsoft 账户才能游玩。

171
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,359
And if you didn't want to migrate your account

172
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,359
如果你不想迁移你的账户

173
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,999
you won't be able to log in anymore

174
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,999
你将无法再登录

175
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:47,199
which means you won't be able to play either.

176
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:47,199
这意味着你也将无法玩游戏。

177
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,579
" In other words, either migrate your account and give Microsoft all of your data

178
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,579
换句话说，要么迁移你的账户并将你的所有数据交给 Microsoft

179
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:51,919
or they take away what you paid for.

180
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:51,919
要么他们就会收回你付费购买的东西。

181
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,099
And this is what you call a threat.

182
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,099
而这就是你所谓的威胁。

183
00:04:54,099 --> 00:05:01,959
But not only did they threaten everyone, they also sneakily modified their terms of service to give themselves permission to cancel your account if they simply felt like it.

184
00:04:54,099 --> 00:05:01,959
但他们不仅威胁了所有人，还偷偷修改了服务条款，让自己有权在心血来潮时取消你的账户。

185
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,779
And you see, when purchasing a game like Minecraft

186
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,779
你看，当你购买像 Minecraft 这样的游戏时

187
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:10,839
that essentially means that you purchased a license to download and play the game where the conditions of that license are within the terms of service.

188
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:10,839
这基本上意味着你购买了一个许可，可以在遵守服务条款的条件下下载并游玩该游戏。

189
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,659
This is important because if a company wanted to change the way a service works

190
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,659
这很重要，因为如果一家公司想要改变某项服务的运作方式

191
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,699
by, for example, changing their terms of service

192
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,699
例如，通过更改他们的服务条款

193
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:22,239
that new version would only apply to the new users or the ones that explicitly agreed to the changes.

194
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:22,239
该新版本只适用于新用户或那些明确同意更改的用户。

195
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:26,139
In simple terms, if the contract used to say that you will be able to play the game

196
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:26,139
简单来说，如果合同中原本写明你将能够玩这款游戏

197
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:31,159
if the company doesn't like that anymore, they can't take it away from you because that would be called breach of contract

198
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:31,159
如果公司后来不再愿意这样做，他们不能剥夺你的权利，因为那将被视为违约。

199
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,359
which is kind of illegal.

200
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,359
这有点违法。

201
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:35,779
And what happened here was that Mojang was forcing everyone to migrate

202
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:35,779
这里发生的事情是 Mojang 强制所有人进行迁移

203
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,119
saying things like, "You will not be able to access the game.

204
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,119
说着类似“你将无法访问游戏”这样的话。

205
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,219
Migration is mandatory.

206
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,219
迁移是强制性的。

207
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:40,159
Won't be able to play Minecraft.

208
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:40,159
将无法玩《Minecraft》。

209
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,615
Must be migrated to a Microsoft.

210
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,615
必须迁移到 Microsoft。

211
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:43,159
" Players need to move to a Microsoft account.

212
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:43,159
“玩家需要迁移到 Microsoft 账户。

213
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,899
Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts.

214
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,899
将 Mojang 账户迁移到 Microsoft 账户。

215
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,719
Where funnily enough, they had the balls to say that this was voluntary three times.

216
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,719
有趣的是，他们竟然有胆量三次说这是自愿的。

217
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:51,039
So voluntary, in fact, that if you didn't do it

218
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:51,039
事实上是如此“自愿”，以至于如果你不这样做

219
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,299
they took away what you paid for.

220
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,299
他们夺走了你所付费的东西。

221
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:55,699
This was a forced migration, where we obviously didn't have much of a choice.

222
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:55,699
这是一次被迫的迁移，我们显然没有太多选择。

223
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,079
The only choice you had was to terminate your account.

224
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,079
你唯一的选择就是注销你的账户。

225
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,009
And not only were they forcing everyone to give-.

226
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,009
而且他们不仅强迫所有人交出——

227
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:00,059
..

228
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:00,059
……

229
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,979
their data to a company with a world record of privacy violations

230
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,979
他们的数据给一家拥有隐私侵犯世界纪录的公司

231
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:08,019
which got recently fined $20 million by the FTC for illegally collecting information on children

232
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:08,019
最近因非法收集儿童信息而被 FTC 罚款 2000 万美元

233
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,939
most Minecraft players are children.

234
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,939
大多数《Minecraft》玩家都是儿童。

235
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,399
But in doing so, they also forced you to agree to Microsoft and Xbox's legal agreements

236
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,399
但在这样做的过程中，他们也迫使你同意了 Microsoft 和 Xbox 的法律协议

237
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,299
all under the threat of them taking away what you paid for if you didn't do what they wanted.

238
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,299
如果你不按他们的要求去做，就会面临他们夺走你已付费物品的威胁。

239
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,959
A contract needs to, uh, be entered into freely

240
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,959
合同需要，呃，自愿签订

241
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,079
and that obviously means that you need to have a

242
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,079
而这显然意味着你需要拥有一个

243
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,459
a choice between agreeing or not agreeing.

244
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,459
在同意或不同意之间做出选择。

245
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:28,179
Just presenting one choice is not really, uh

246
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:28,179
只提供一个选择其实并不算，呃

247
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,100
an agreement.

248
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,100
一种协议。

249
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,559
But even though it was illegal, Mojang still went ahead with it

250
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,559
但即使这是非法的，Mojang 仍然继续推进

251
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,700
which resulted in millions of people losing access to what they paid for

252
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,700
这导致数百万人失去了他们所付费购买的内容的使用权

253
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,700
some of which were never even notified that it was happening to begin with

254
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,700
其中有些人甚至从一开始就没有收到任何通知

255
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,020
only finding out years later that their purchase had been nullified.

256
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,020
多年后才发现他们的购买已被作废。

257
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,079
But when actually contacting Mojang to complain, you'd come to find that they wouldn't answer questions

258
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,079
但当真正联系 Mojang 投诉时，你会发现他们不会回答问题

259
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,039
and automatically close most tickets asking for answers.

260
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,039
并会自动关闭大多数要求答复的工单。

261
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,247
And when asking Microsoft about it, they would say that.

262
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,247
当询问微软时，他们会这么说。

263
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:50,299
..

264
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:50,299
..

265
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:56,575
"I've discussed your issue with Mojang support and came to the conclusion that the migration is within the Minecraft Terms and Conditions.

266
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:56,575
“我已与 Mojang 支持团队讨论了你的问题，并得出结论，迁移符合《Minecraft 条款与条件》。

267
00:06:56,575 --> 00:06:59,773
" In other words, "We've investigated ourselves and found nothing wrong.

268
00:06:56,575 --> 00:06:59,773
换句话说，“我们自查后发现自己没有任何问题。”

269
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:02,219
" But unfortunately for them, this user knows his rights.

270
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:02,219
“但不幸的是，对他们来说，这位用户知道自己的权利。”

271
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:07,159
And when asking Microsoft to cite his contract for where it says that a Microsoft account is required to play

272
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:07,159
当要求微软引用合同中说明必须拥有 Microsoft 账户才能游玩的条款时

273
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:10,579
Microsoft said, "End User License Agreements are constantly updated.

274
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:10,579
微软表示：“最终用户许可协议会不断更新。

275
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,279
Please refer to the current one," where the current one says

276
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,279
请参阅当前版本”，而当前版本中写道

277
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,539
"If you originally signed up through a Mojang account

278
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,539
“如果您最初是通过 Mojang 账户注册的

279
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,873
you must migrate to a Microsoft account in order to keep using the services.

280
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,873
你必须迁移到 Microsoft 账户才能继续使用这些服务。

281
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:21,839
" But this wasn't part of the contract when the user had bought the game

282
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:21,839
“但这在用户购买游戏时并不是合同的一部分

283
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,319
to which Microsoft replied, "I understand that this is your interpretation

284
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,319
对此 Microsoft 回应道：“我理解这是你的理解

285
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,049
but this EULA applies for any user regardless of the date of creation

286
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,049
但本最终用户许可协议适用于任何用户，无论创建日期如何

287
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,319
" further stating that, "Your contract is the new EULA.

288
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,319
并进一步声明：“您的合同是新的最终用户许可协议。

289
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,759
The old one doesn't apply anymore.

290
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,759
旧的已不再适用。

291

You agreed to these Terms by using the service.

292
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,876
您在使用本服务时即表示同意这些条款。

293
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:36,779
" Where they then immediately closed the ticket

294
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:36,779
“然后他们立即关闭了工单

295
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,979
refusing to answer any further questions.

296
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,979
拒绝回答任何进一步的问题。

297
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,259
And this is a perfect example of fucking up in writing

298
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,259
而这正是写作中搞砸的一个完美例子

299
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,816
because it confirms the idea that.

300
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,816
因为它印证了这样的想法。

301
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:43,879
..

302
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:43,879
..

303
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,299
It is up to you to check back to see if these guidelines have changed.

304
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,299
是否有这些指南的变更，需要你自己回来查看。

305
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:52,619
And that they don't care about agreement, since they claim that you agreed to changes that they didn't even tell you about.

306
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:52,619
而且他们并不在乎是否达成一致，因为他们声称你已经同意了他们甚至没有告知你的更改。

307
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:56,359
So Mojang voided everyone's contract since they say that they don't apply anymore.

308
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:56,359
所以 Mojang 宣布所有人的合同作废，因为他们说这些合同已经不再适用。

309
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:59,039
And you fucking guessed it, this is breach of contract.

310
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:59,039
没错，你他妈的猜对了，这就是违约。

311
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,479
And if that wasn't bad enough, when actually looking at the historical changes to the contracts

312
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,479
如果这还不够糟糕的话，当你真正去查看合同的历史变更时

313
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,979
there used to be a clause that says that you will be able to play the game even if you don't agree to the new changes

314
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,979
以前还有一条条款写着，即使你不同意新的变更，你也能继续玩游戏。

315
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,619
all of which were, of course, sneakily removed during the migration.

316
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,619
当然，这些在迁移过程中都被偷偷移除了。

317
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:14,379
I would say that this, uh, forceful way of

318
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:14,379
我会说，这种，呃，强制性的

319
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:19,139
um, migrating the customers is not a term that is enforceable by Microsoft

320
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:19,139
嗯，将客户迁移的方式，并不是微软可以强制执行的条款。

321
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,799
which in this case would mean that they would be forced to reinstate the old accounts.

322
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,799
在这种情况下，这将意味着他们将被迫恢复旧账户。

323
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,919
And all of this is essentially what the class action lawsuit is about.

324
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,919
而这一切本质上正是集体诉讼的核心内容。

325
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,719
Minecraft's success is entirely due to the community making it what it is

326
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,719
Minecraft 的成功完全归功于社区将它塑造成如今的样子。

327
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:33,999
through, for example, mods and servers, because the base game in itself isn't really that interesting.

328
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:33,999
例如，通过模组和服务器，因为基础游戏本身并不是那么有趣。

329
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:40,318
And when the very things that we depend on to actually enjoy the game are being threatened by a company that ignores our rights like this

330
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:40,318
而当我们真正依赖来享受游戏的那些东西，被一家这样无视我们权利的公司威胁时

331
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:45,119
we as consumers end up being affected because Mojang is restricting the way we're able to play the game.

332
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:45,119
作为消费者的我们最终会受到影响，因为 Mojang 正在限制我们玩游戏的方式。

333
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:50,259
On top of them literally taking the game away under threat simply because they knew that nobody would be fighting back.

334
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:50,259
他们之所以在威胁下直接把游戏拿走，只是因为他们知道没人会反抗。

335
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:54,599
But there's a limit to the amount of shit that people are willing to take before taking measures.

336
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:54,599
但人们能忍受的烂事是有限的，超过这个限度就会采取行动。

337
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:55,399
And Mojang?

338
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:55,399
至于 Mojang 呢？

339
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,039
You fucking crossed it, because we're not begging or asking for mercy anymore.

340
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,039
你他妈的越界了，因为我们不再乞求或请求怜悯了。

341
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,339
This is a class action lawsuit that you cannot ignore.

342
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,339
这是一起你无法忽视的集体诉讼。

343
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,119
I think this is an important, uh

344
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,119
我认为这是一个重要的，呃

345
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:08,579
case for this reason that this is becoming a general business practice right now

346
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:08,579
正因如此，这正在成为一种普遍的商业做法

347
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:11,779
and it's not supposed to be like that when you're dealing with consumers

348
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:11,779
而在与消费者打交道时，本不应该是这样的

349
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:12,639
especially children.

350
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:12,639
尤其是对待儿童时。

351
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:20,419
We are seeing a lot of companies coming out with this claim that you don't get the full terms of service or for their product when you buy it.

352
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:20,419
我们看到很多公司声称，当你购买他们的产品时，你并不能获得完整的服务条款。

353
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:23,119
The company you're buying from refer you to their

354
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:23,119
你购买的公司会将你引导至他们

355
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:26,719
uh, contractual terms on the website, which can change at any time

356
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:26,719
呃，网站上的合同条款，而这些条款可能随时更改。

357
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:29,739
basically depriving you all your consumer rights.

358
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:29,739
基本上剥夺了你所有的消费者权益。

359
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:30,819
And this is not right.

360
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:30,819
而这是不对的。

361
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,979
This is something really needed to, uh

362
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,979
这确实是需要，呃

363
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:36,899
act upon and make sure that we can exer- exercise our consumer rights.

364
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:36,899
采取行动并确保我们能够行使消费者权利。

365
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,739
And our objectives are quite simple.

366
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,739
我们的目标非常简单。

367
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:46,559
Revert the account migration, meaning the reinstatement of all unmigrated accounts where Mojang in the EU has to be the owner of all customer data

368
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:46,559
撤销账户迁移，也就是说恢复所有未迁移的账户，并且在欧盟范围内，Mojang 必须是所有客户数据的所有者。

369
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,419
comply with contract and consumer protection laws, so notify about the changes

370
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,419
遵守合同和消费者保护法，因此需通知变更事项

371
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:54,019
get agreement for the changes without threatening a consequence for disagreement

372
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:54,019
在不以不同意会产生后果相威胁的情况下，取得对变更的同意

373
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:58,099
remove unenforceable clauses, including hidden clauses like the one that allows gambling

374
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:58,099
删除不可执行的条款，包括隐藏条款，例如允许赌博的条款

375
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:02,979
clearly indicate when changes happen, and comply with the terms of our old contracts.

376
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:02,979
清楚地表明何时发生变更，并遵守我们旧合同的条款。

377
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:06,439
I think these goals are re- both reasonable and achievable

378
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:06,439
我认为这些目标既合理又可实现

379
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,659
and saying that is coming from looking at what this case is all about

380
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,659
而这样说是基于对这个案件本质的了解

381
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:17,439
which is, uh, a big corporation abusing consumer rights and doing so without anybody responding to it would be wrong.

382
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:17,439
也就是说，呃，一个大公司侵犯消费者权益，而没有人对此作出回应，这是不对的。

383
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:20,519
But as you might have expected, the legal system is kind of complicated

384
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:20,519
但正如你可能预料的那样，法律体系有点复杂

385
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,119
because if we take these two examples, even though the core of the issue is the same

386
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,119
因为如果我们看这两个例子，尽管问题的核心是相同的

387
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:27,019
our contracts, there's a difference in who was affected by them.

388
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:27,019
我们的合同中，受影响的人有所不同。

389
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,259
Basically, you need to have the same kind of damage and the same kind of circumstances for everybody that

390
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,259
基本上，所有参与集体诉讼的人都需要有相同类型的损害和相同类型的情况。

391
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:33,819
uh, goes into the class action.

392
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:33,819
呃，才能加入集体诉讼。

393
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:36,859
So they would each have a different way of approaching it legally

394
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:36,859
所以他们在法律上会有不同的处理方式

395
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:41,339
some being easier to pursue than others, which is why the account migration is such a great option

396
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:41,339
有些比其他的更容易追究，这就是为什么账户迁移是一个很好的选择

397
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,559
because you paid for something which they then took from you under threat

398
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,559
因为你为某样东西付了钱，而他们却在威胁下把它从你那里夺走

399
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,339
all of which is very easily quantifiable damages

400
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,339
所有这些都是非常容易量化的损害

401
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:53,439
which basically affected everyone before 2023, including those who did migrate because it was done under threat.

402
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:53,439
这基本上在 2023 年之前影响了所有人，包括那些确实迁移了的人，因为这是在威胁下进行的。

403
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:56,039
And since the account migration is tied to our contracts

404
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:56,039
而且由于账户迁移与我们的合同绑定

405
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,199
just like everything else, we can then use it to resolve most issues with a single process.

406
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,199
就像其他所有事情一样，我们可以用一个流程来解决大多数问题。

407
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:03,819
We need to decide on how we formulate this claim.

408
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:03,819
我们需要决定如何表述这一主张。

409
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:07,319
What is the damage that's been done and how are we going to prove that?

410
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:07,319
造成了什么损害，我们将如何证明这一点？

411
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:11,019
And, uh, actually the evidence is gonna decide for us how we're gonna do this.

412
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:11,019
而且，嗯，实际上证据会为我们决定我们将如何处理这件事。

413
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:12,579
And that is the reason for this video

414
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:12,579
这就是制作本视频的原因

415
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,579
because we are now at the stage where we need you

416
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,579
因为我们现在已经到了需要你

417
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:18,219
the Minecraft player, to say that you want to participate in the class action lawsuit

418
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:18,219
这位《Minecraft》玩家，来表明你想参与集体诉讼的阶段

419
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:22,999
and to tell us how you were affected so that we can then identify and form the group that will participate.

420
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:22,999
并告诉我们你受到了怎样的影响，这样我们就能确定并组建将要参与的团队。

421
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:29,459
And the more submissions we get, the more likely we are to achieve what we've set out to do and show Mojang that they don't get to do whatever the fuck they want.

422
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:29,459
我们收到的提交越多，我们就越有可能实现我们的目标，并向 Mojang 表明他们不能为所欲为。

423
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:36,599
Obviously, it's always decided on the evidence and how well we can present that to a court and make them understand what's actually at stake here

424
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:36,599
显然，这一切总是取决于证据，以及我们能多好地将其呈现给法庭，让他们明白这里真正的利害关系。

425
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:41,299
which is the consumer's, uh, right to actually resist being abused by a big company.

426
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:41,299
这是消费者，呃，真正有权利去抵制被大公司欺压。

427
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,359
Where the first thing I want to say is thank you

428
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,359
我首先想说的是谢谢你们

429
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:49,719
because it's thanks to those donations that we now actually have a chance to fight back in a way that's never really been done before

430
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:49,719
因为正是有了这些捐助，我们现在才真正有机会以一种前所未有的方式进行反击。

431
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,879
and if we win, Mojang will also have to pay back our legal costs

432
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,879
如果我们赢了，Mojang 也必须偿还我们的法律费用

433
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,159
which also unfortunately goes the other way, meaning that I would essentially go bankrupt if we were to lose

434
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,159
但不幸的是，这种情况也可能反过来，这意味着如果我们输了，我基本上会破产

435
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,979
which is always a possibility.

436
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,979
而这种情况总是有可能发生的。

437
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:05,019
But I don't want to live with the regret of not trying simply because I was too afraid of losing.

438
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:05,019
但我不想因为害怕失败而不去尝试，从而带着遗憾生活。

439
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:06,099
So bring it on, Mojang.

440
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:06,099
那就放马过来吧，Mojang。

441
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,639
I'll see you in court.

442
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,639
法庭上见。

443
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,539
 And even though it feels a little bit wrong to mention it
