1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
This is Minecraft, the game that screwed

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,000
its community so hard that we're about

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,320
to sue them in a class action lawsuit.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,240
You see, in December of 2024, I uploaded

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,679
this video in which I exposed Mojang,

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,440
the creators of Minecraft, for breaking

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,960
consumer protection laws and exposing

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,560
children to gambling. And while I tried

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,240
to seek justice for myself, I wasn't

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,840
able to do so. Because my government is

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,920
kind of incompetent, making access to

12
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,760
justice basically impossible if you're

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,680
not rich as [ __ ] So, I tried adding a

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,760
GoFundMe campaign at the end to finance

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,279
a class action lawsuit because this

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,279
wasn't something that affected just me.

17
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,960
And obviously there's no way that would

18
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,640
actually work, right?

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,160
>> YouTube and suing Mo

20
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,800
already nearly on a million on trending

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,559
right now. Completed it already for

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,520
$120,000.

23
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,640
No way to pass.

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,840
>> That's got to be one of the fastest

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,640
growing crowdfunding campaigns.

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,480
>> We raised $150,000 within days.

27
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,480
>> Oh, it's [ __ ] happening. Where we now

28
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,399
have access to legal representation and

29
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,960
can proceed with the class action

30
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,719
lawsuit.

31
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,480
>> Yes, my name is Bjon Pasha. I'm a member

32
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,800
of the Swedish Bor Association. I run a

33
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,320
law firm together with my colleague law

34
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,000
and we're working with this lawsuit

35
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,200
since it's part of our practice and are

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,960
looking to um run this lawsuit as a

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,479
class action against Muya because we

38
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,600
think it's an important issue that needs

39
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,200
to be addressed. To give you a little

40
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,119
recap, Minecraft is one of those games

41
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,119
that anyone can modify to add things

42
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,040
that it didn't originally have. And what

43
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,960
I wanted to do was add guns to the game

44
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,159
to recreate an old game mode that I used

45
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
to play as a child that had

46
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,000
unfortunately been shut down. But right

47
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,080
as it was about to release, Mojang said

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,439
that a recent directive from Mojang

49
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,040
leadership determined that guns and

50
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,320
weapons are considered non-compliant

51
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,680
features, meaning that they had to be

52
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,360
completely removed, implying the

53
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,479
shutdown of dozens of projects,

54
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,840
including mine. But when actually

55
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,680
looking into it, even though they said

56
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
that guns and weapons were specifically

57
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,320
prohibited by the game's legal

58
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,159
agreement, when actually looking for

59
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,560
these specific prohibitions, you'd come

60
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,640
to find that they didn't actually exist.

61
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,079
So Mojang was making [ __ ] up and

62
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,759
pretending it was part of the terms of

63
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,520
service, a type of contract, which, as

64
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,119
you've guessed, is kind of illegal. A

65
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,960
contract is an agreement between two

66
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,799
parties and both parties need to agree

67
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,960
what the meaning of the contract is. You

68
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,479
can't be forced into new rules that

69
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,640
apply to your contract unless you've

70
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,640
been notified as well as having a choice

71
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,039
whether to actually accept those terms

72
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,959
or just be able to keep using what you

73
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,800
already have. And since this is a hidden

74
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,959
clause where guns are just one of the

75
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,560
many examples that exist, Mojang can do

76
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
whatever they want, like applying a

77
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,520
different version of the same clause

78
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,040
where you never know which one you're

79
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,720
going to get. changing their minds at

80
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,800
any time, like they did with the guns

81
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,640
three times, and even go against their

82
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,239
own rules, like allowing gambling even

83
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,000
though they publicly pretend like it's

84
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,840
forbidden. But obviously, [ __ ] gets

85
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,599
worse because when a company changes its

86
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,599
terms of service, it's required to

87
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,120
notify its users about the changes and

88
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,360
get their agreement for it. And out of

89
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
the 47 times they changed their legal

90
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,959
agreements, they never told anyone about

91
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,640
it. We know this because I went through

92
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,000
thousands of archived pages for every

93
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,840
single legal agreement that the game has

94
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,760
ever had to see if a single word had

95
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,680
changed. and Mojang not notifying anyone

96
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,760
of changes makes perfect sense since in

97
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,519
their own words it is up to you to check

98
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,720
back to see if these guidelines have

99
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,640
changed so that it's not their

100
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,560
responsibility to tell you there's a lot

101
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,400
of things that you really can't do with

102
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,400
the contract and have it enforceable

103
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,959
against the consumers you have this

104
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,120
legislation under European consumer law

105
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,760
that mandates that the company that

106
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,360
changes terms need to inform the

107
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,159
consumers about this and they can't

108
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
enforce the new changes without giving

109
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,200
the consumers a choice

110
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,000
>> and if without telling anyone who wasn't

111
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,239
already bad enough.

112
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,840
>> They removed the notice when software

113
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,840
tones were updated. This is obviously

114
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,800
making it harder for the consumers to

115
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,080
exercise their rights

116
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,599
>> because not only is it our

117
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,280
responsibility to check when changes

118
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,879
happen, but they also make it borderline

119
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,640
impossible to tell when they actually

120
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,480
did. Which is quite ironic coming from

121
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,959
the company that says, "We are trying to

122
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,599
be open, honest, and most importantly

123
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
trusting."

124
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,720
>> But of course, it only gets worse.

125
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,720
Remember how the original email from

126
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
Mojang said that guns were specifically

127
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,920
prohibited by these three legal

128
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,680
agreements? or one of them didn't even

129
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,519
exist. This is something I even pointed

130
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,040
out in the last video. By the Mojang

131
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,799
brand guidelines, guidelines that

132
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,959
literally do not exist. Well, it turns

133
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,360
out that they do exist as its own hidden

134
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,120
internal document under strict NDA that

135
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,879
does contain the prohibitions for guns.

136
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,959
The very same document where Mojang

137
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,640
internally recognizes loot boxes as

138
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,159
gambling. And what pisses me off even

139
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,840
more than them trying to apply a

140
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,360
contract that was literally impossible

141
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,040
to access without whistleblowers was

142
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,799
that while they left us on hold for 6

143
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,040
months because their CEO was on

144
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,120
vacation, they officially partnered with

145
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,680
Nerf, the gun company. Even though these

146
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,680
guidelines say that gunlike toys are

147
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,880
forbidden, [ __ ] hypocrites. But as

148
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,639
you probably guessed it, it only gets

149
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,560
worse. You see, when buying Minecraft,

150
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,080
you create a Mojang account that is then

151
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,759
used to play the game. At least that's

152
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,560
how it used to be because Mojang was

153
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,160
bought by Microsoft in 2014 where just a

154
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,080
few years later Mojang would announce

155
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
that we've decided that moving forward

156
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,680
all of our games will require a

157
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Microsoft account to play. And if you

158
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280
didn't want to migrate your account, you

159
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,280
won't be able to log in anymore, which

160
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,639
means you won't be able to play either.

161
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,320
In other words, either migrate your

162
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,759
account and give Microsoft all of your

163
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,160
data or they take away what you paid

164
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,919
for. And this is what you call a threat.

165
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,840
But not only did they threaten everyone,

166
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,520
they also sneakily modified their terms

167
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,360
of service to give themselves permission

168
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,560
to cancel your account if they simply

169
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,080
felt like it. And you see, when

170
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,440
purchasing a game like Minecraft, that

171
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,680
essentially means that you purchase a

172
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,440
license to download and play the game

173
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,199
where the conditions of that license are

174
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,199
within the terms of service. This is

175
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,960
important because if a company wanted to

176
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,320
change the way a service works by, for

177
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,080
example, changing their terms of

178
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,240
service, that new version would only

179
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,479
apply to the new users or the ones that

180
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,320
explicitly agreed to the changes. In

181
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,840
simple terms, if the contract used to

182
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,440
say that you will be able to play the

183
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,960
game, if the company doesn't like that

184
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,560
anymore, they can't take it away from

185
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,479
you because that would be called breach

186
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,160
of contract, which is kind of illegal.

187
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,080
And what happened here was that Mojang

188
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,520
was forcing everyone to migrate, saying

189
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,360
things like, "You will not be able to

190
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,639
access the game. Migration is mandatory.

191
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,759
Won't be able to play Minecraft. Must be

192
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,199
migrated to a Microsoft

193
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,960
>> Players need to move to a Microsoft

194
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,479
>> Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts."

195
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,320
>> Where funnily enough, they had the balls

196
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,560
to say that this was voluntary three

197
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,919
times. So voluntary in fact that if you

198
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,479
didn't do it, they took away what you

199
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,160
paid for.

200
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,680
>> This was a forced migration where you

201
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,520
obviously didn't have much of a choice.

202
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
The only choice you had was to terminate

203
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,600
your account.

204
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
>> And not only were they forcing everyone

205
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,960
to give their data to a company with a

206
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,039
world record of privacy violations,

207
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,960
which got recently fined to $20 million

208
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,960
by the FTC for illegally collecting

209
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,639
information on children. Most Minecraft

210
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,080
players are children. But in doing so,

211
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,400
they also forced you to agree to

212
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,919
Microsoft and Xbox's legal agreements.

213
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,600
fall under the threat of them taking

214
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,319
away what you paid for if you didn't do

215
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,560
what they wanted.

216
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,240
>> A contract needs to be entered into

217
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
freely and that obviously means that you

218
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,639
need to have a choice between agreeing

219
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,360
and not agreeing. Just presenting one

220
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,880
choice is not really an agreement. But

221
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,400
even though it was illegal, Mojang still

222
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,080
went ahead with it, which resulted in

223
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,680
millions of people losing access to what

224
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,360
they paid for. Some of which were never

225
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,960
even notified that it was happening to

226
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,039
begin with, only finding out years later

227
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,639
that their purchase had been nullified.

228
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,000
But when actually contacting Mojang to

229
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
complain, you'd come to find that they

230
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,440
wouldn't answer questions and

231
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,120
automatically close most tickets asking

232
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,639
for answers. And when asking Microsoft

233
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,479
about it, they would say that, "I've

234
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,000
discussed your issue with Mojang support

235
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,000
and came to the conclusion that the

236
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,520
migration is within the Minecraft terms

237
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,440
and conditions." In other words, we've

238
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,199
investigated ourselves and found nothing

239
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
wrong. But unfortunately for them, this

240
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,880
user knows his rights. And when asking

241
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,479
Microsoft to site his contract for where

242
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,080
it says that a Microsoft account is

243
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,599
required to play, Microsoft said, "And

244
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,520
end user license agreements are

245
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,360
constantly updated. Please refer to the

246
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,280
current one where the current one says

247
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,120
if you originally signed up for a Mojang

248
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,560
account, you must migrate to a Microsoft

249
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,080
account in order to keep using the

250
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,599
services. But this wasn't part of the

251
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,520
contract when the user had bought the

252
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,560
game. To which Microsoft replied, I

253
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,720
understand that this is your

254
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,639
interpretation, but this ULA applies for

255
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,160
any user regardless of the date of

256
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,919
creation. Further stating that your

257
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,360
contract is the new ULA. The old one

258
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,199
doesn't apply anymore. You agreed to

259
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,880
these terms by using the service where

260
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,479
they then immediately close the ticket

261
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,199
refusing to answer any further

262
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,720
questions. This is a perfect example of

263
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,720
[ __ ] up in writing because it

264
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,720
confirms the idea that it is up to you

265
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,240
to check back to see if these guidelines

266
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,840
have changed and that they don't care

267
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,599
about agreements since they claim that

268
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,759
you agreed to changes that they didn't

269
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,360
even tell you about. So Mojang voided

270
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,800
everyone's contract since they say that

271
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
they don't apply anymore. And you

272
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,479
[ __ ] guessed it, this is breach of

273
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,400
contract. And if that wasn't bad enough,

274
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,000
when actually looking at the historical

275
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,520
changes to the contracts, there used to

276
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,879
be a clause that says that you will be

277
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,639
able to play the game even if you don't

278
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,879
agree to the new changes. All of which

279
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,680
were of course sneakily removed during

280
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,560
the migration.

281
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,120
>> I would say that this uh forceful way of

282
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,360
um migrating the customers is not a term

283
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,960
that is enforcable by by Microsoft which

284
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,879
in this case would mean that they would

285
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,639
be forced to reinstate the old accounts.

286
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,000
And all of this is essentially what the

287
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,240
class action lawsuit is about.

288
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,759
Minecraft's success is entirely due to

289
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,360
the community making it what it is

290
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,120
through, for example, mods and servers

291
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,479
because the base game in itself isn't

292
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,080
really that interesting. And when the

293
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,440
very things that we depend on to

294
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,519
actually enjoy the game are being

295
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,519
threatened by a company that ignores our

296
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,200
rights like this, we as consumers end up

297
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,720
being affected because Mojang is

298
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,320
restricting the way we're able to play

299
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,160
the game. On top of them literally

300
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,680
taking the game away under threat simply

301
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,360
because they knew that nobody would be

302
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,800
fighting back. But there's a limit to

303
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,640
the amount of [ __ ] that people are

304
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,399
willing to take before taking measures.

305
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,240
And Mojang, you [ __ ] crossed it.

306
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,560
Because we're not begging or asking for

307
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,560
mercy anymore. This is a class action

308
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,519
lawsuit that you cannot ignore. I think

309
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,440
this is an important uh case for this

310
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,200
reason that this is becoming a general

311
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,880
business practice right now and it's not

312
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,160
supposed to be like that when you

313
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,600
dealing with consumers especially

314
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,279
children. We're seeing a lot of

315
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,000
companies coming out with this claim

316
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,000
that you don't get the full terms of

317
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,680
service or for their product when you

318
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,720
buy it. The company you're buying from

319
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,800
refer you to their contractual terms on

320
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,959
the website which can change at any time

321
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,880
basically depriving you all your

322
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,279
consumer rights. And this is not right.

323
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,600
This is something we really need to uh

324
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,959
act upon and make sure that we can

325
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,800
exercise our consumer rights.

326
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,399
>> And our objectives are quite simple.

327
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,480
Revert the account migration, meaning

328
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,720
the reinstatement of all unmigrated

329
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,720
accounts where Mojang in the EU has to

330
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,320
be the owner of all customer data.

331
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,080
Comply with contract and consumer

332
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,839
protection laws. So notify about the

333
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,360
changes, get agreement for the changes

334
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,120
without threatening a consequence for

335
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,880
disagreement, remove uninforceable

336
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,640
clauses, including hidden clauses like

337
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,640
the one that allows gambling. clearly

338
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,959
indicate when changes happen and comply

339
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,440
with the terms of our old contracts.

340
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,160
>> I think these goals are both reasonable

341
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,240
and achievable and saying that is coming

342
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,040
from looking at what this case is all

343
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,200
about which is a big corporation abusing

344
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,440
consumer rights and doing so without

345
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,040
anybody responding to it would be wrong.

346
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,959
>> But as you might have expected the legal

347
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,560
system is kind of complicated because if

348
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,480
we take these two examples even though

349
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,079
the core of the issue is the same our

350
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,680
contracts there's a difference in who

351
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,600
was affected by them. Basically, you

352
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,279
need to have the same kind of damage and

353
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
the same kind of circumstances for

354
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,040
everybody that goes into the class

355
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,959
action. So, they would each have a

356
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,800
different way of approaching it legally.

357
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,480
Some being easier to pursue than others.

358
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,320
Which is why the account migration is

359
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,920
such a great option because you paid for

360
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,680
something which they then took from you

361
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,680
under threat. All of which is very

362
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,560
easily quantifiable damages which

363
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,240
basically affected everyone before 2023

364
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,000
including those who did migrate because

365
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,600
it was done under threat. And since the

366
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,279
account migration is tied to our

367
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,040
contracts just like everything else, we

368
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,240
can then use it to resolve most issues

369
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,120
with a single process.

370
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,120
>> We need to decide on how we formulate

371
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,959
this claim. What is the damage that's

372
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,040
been done? And how are we going to prove

373
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,480
that? And uh actually the evidence is

374
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,160
going to decide for us how we're going

375
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,600
to do this. And that is the reason for

376
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,200
this video because we are now at the

377
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,399
stage where we need you, the Minecraft

378
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,240
player, to say that you want to

379
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,839
participate in the class action lawsuit

380
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,920
and to tell us how you were affected so

381
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,279
that we can then identify and form the

382
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,720
group that will participate. And the

383
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,399
more submissions we get, the more likely

384
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,079
we are to achieve what we've set out to

385
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,519
do and show Mojang that they don't get

386
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,920
to do whatever the [ __ ] they want.

387
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,680
>> Obviously, it's always decided on the

388
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,279
evidence and how well we can present

389
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,040
that to a court and make them understand

390
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,760
what's actually at stake here, which is

391
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,360
the consumer's right to actually resist

392
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,880
being abused by a big company.

393
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,800
>> Well, the first thing I want to say is

394
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,720
thank you because it's thanks to those

395
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,320
donations that we now actually have a

396
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,079
chance to fight back in a way that's

397
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,079
never really been done before. And if we

398
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,680
win, Mojang will also have to pay back

399
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,279
our legal costs, which also

400
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,640
unfortunately goes the other way.

401
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,800
Meaning that I would essentially go

402
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,880
bankrupt if we were to lose, which is

403
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,959
always a possibility. But I don't want

404
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,560
to live with the regret of not trying

405
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,560
simply because I was too afraid of

406
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,279
losing. So bring it on, Mojang. I'll see

407
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,279
you in court.

408
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,399
And even though it feels a little bit

409
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,079
wrong to mention it, we are fighting a

410
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,440
billion dollar corporation that can [ __ ]

411
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,279
out money faster than privacy

412
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,480
violations. If you do feel like

413
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,920
supporting what we're doing, the

414
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,920
GoFundMe still exists.
