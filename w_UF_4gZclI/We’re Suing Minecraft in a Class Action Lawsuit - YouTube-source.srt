1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:05,960
This is Minecraft, the game that screwed its community so hard that we're about to sue them in a class action lawsuit.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,159
You see, in December of 2024, I uploaded this video in which I exposed Mojang

3
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:14,299
the creators of Minecraft, for breaking consumer protection law and exposing children to gambling.

4
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:16,119
And while I tried to seek justice for myself

5
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,059
I wasn't able to do so because my government is kind of incompetent

6
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,699
making access to justice basically impossible if you're not rich as fuck.

7
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,180
So I tried adding a GoFundMe campaign at the end to finance a class action lawsuit

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,279
because this wasn't something that affected just me.

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,979
And obviously, there's no way that would actually work

10
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:32,399
right?

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,099
YouTuber Kiabru- Is suing Mojang.

12
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:37,719
Illegally changing- They publicly funded- It's already nearly on a million Gs.

13
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,599
19 on trending right now.

14
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:39,060
It's exceeded it.

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,779
Completed its funding.

16
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:41,680
Already passed- $120,000.

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,520
That's a lot.

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
No way the class- Dude, look at this.

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,759
That's gotta be one of the fastest-growing crowdfunding campaigns.

20
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,559
We raised $150,000 within days.

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,899
Oh, it's fucking happening.

22
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:54,939
Where we now have access to legal representation and can proceed with the class action lawsuit.

23
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:55,200
Yes.

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,340
My name is Bjorn Persson.

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,939
I'm a member of the Swedish Borrower Association.

26
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,939
I run a law firm together with my colleague

27
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:00,739
Conny Larsson.

28
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,578
And we're working with this lawsuit since it's part of our practice and are looking to

29
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:10,939
um, run this, uh, lawsuit as a class action against Mojang because we think it's an important issue that needs to be addressed.

30
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:16,699
To give you a little recap, Minecraft is one of those games that anyone can modify to add things that it didn't originally have.

31
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:23,639
And what I wanted to do was add guns to the game to recreate an old game that I used to play as a child that had unfortunately been shut down.

32
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:25,299
But right as it was about to release

33
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:31,327
Mojang said that, "A recent directive from Mojang leadership determined that guns and weapons were considered non-compliant features.

34
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,059
" Meaning that they had to be completely removed

35
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,959
implying the shutdown of dozens of projects, including mine.

36
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:41,399
But when actually looking into it, even though they said that guns and weapons were specifically prohibited by the game's legal agreement

37
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:46,579
when actually looking for these specific prohibitions, you'd come to find that they didn't actually exist.

38
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:50,419
So Mojang was making shit up and pretending it was part of the Terms of Service

39
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:52,179
a type of contract, which as you've guessed

40
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,259
is kind of illegal.

41
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:58,479
A contract is an agreement between two parties and both parties need to agree what the meaning of the contract is.

42
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,219
You can't be forced into new rules that apply to your contract unless you've been notified

43
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:09,519
as well as having a choice whether to actually accept those terms or just be able to keep using what you already have.

44
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:14,099
And since this is a hidden clause where guns are just one of the many examples that exist

45
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,919
Mojang can do whatever they want, like applying a different version of the same clause so you never know which one you're gonna get

46
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,359
changing their minds at any time, like they did with the guns three times

47
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:28,679
and even go against their own rules, like allowing gambling even though they publicly pretend like it's forbidden.

48
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,259
But obviously, shit gets worse.

49
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,699
Because when a company changes its terms of service

50
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,599
it's required to notify its users about the changes and get their agreement for it.

51
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,779
And out of the 47 times they changed their legal agreements

52
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:41,459
they never told anyone about it.

53
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:48,239
We know this because I went through thousands of archived pages for every single legal agreement that the game has ever had to see if a single word had changed.

54
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,199
And Mojang not notifying anyone of changes makes perfect sense

55
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,799
since in their own words, "It is up to you to check back to see if these guidelines have changed

56
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,059
" so that it's not their responsibility to tell you.

57
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:03,659
There's a lot of things that you really can't do with the contract and have it enforceable against the consumers.

58
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,359
You have this legislation under European consumer law that

59
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,759
uh, mandates that the company that changes

60
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,819
uh, the terms need to inform the consumers about this.

61
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,999
And they can't enforce the, the new changes without giving

62
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,239
uh, the consumers a choice.

63
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,059
And if not telling anyone wasn't already bad enough- They removed the notice when the software terms were updated.

64
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:26,779
This is obviously making it harder for the consumers to exercise their rights.

65
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:29,899
Because not only is it our responsibility to check when changes happen

66
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:33,139
but they also make it borderline impossible to tell when they actually did.

67
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,659
Which is quite ironic coming from the company that says

68
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,559
"We are trying to be open, honest

69
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,457
and most importantly, trusting.

70
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:41,019
" But of course, it only gets worse.

71
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:48,259
Remember how the original email from Mojang said that guns were specifically prohibited by these three legal agreements where one of them didn't even exist?

72
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,659
This is something I even pointed out in the last video.

73
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:54,159
By the Mojang brand guidelines, guidelines that literally do not exist.

74
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:01,019
Well, it turns out that they do exist as its own hidden internal document under a strict NDA that does contain the prohibitions for guns.

75
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,439
The very same document where Mojang internally recognizes loot boxes as gambling.

76
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:15,339
And what pisses me off even more than them trying to apply a contract that was literally impossible to access without whistleblowers was that while they left us on hold for six months because their CEO was on vacation

77
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,399
they officially partnered with Nerf, the gun company

78
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,239
even though these guidelines say that gun-like toys are forbidden.

79
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,339
Fucking hypocrites.

80
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:25,159
But as you probably guessed it, it only gets worse.

81
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:29,479
You see, when buying Minecraft, you create a Mojang account that is then used to play the game.

82
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:30,779
At least, that's how it used to be.

83
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:33,839
Because Mojang was bought by Microsoft in 2014

84
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,399
where just a few years later, Mojang would announce that

85
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,979
"We've decided that moving forward, all of our games will require a Microsoft account to play.

86
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,359
And if you didn't want to migrate your account

87
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,999
you won't be able to log in anymore

88
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:47,199
which means you won't be able to play either.

89
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,579
" In other words, either migrate your account and give Microsoft all of your data

90
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:51,919
or they take away what you paid for.

91
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,099
And this is what you call a threat.

92
00:04:54,099 --> 00:05:01,959
But not only did they threaten everyone, they also sneakily modified their terms of service to give themselves permission to cancel your account if they simply felt like it.

93
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,779
And you see, when purchasing a game like Minecraft

94
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:10,839
that essentially means that you purchased a license to download and play the game where the conditions of that license are within the terms of service.

95
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,659
This is important because if a company wanted to change the way a service works

96
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,699
by, for example, changing their terms of service

97
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:22,239
that new version would only apply to the new users or the ones that explicitly agreed to the changes.

98
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:26,139
In simple terms, if the contract used to say that you will be able to play the game

99
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:31,159
if the company doesn't like that anymore, they can't take it away from you because that would be called breach of contract

100
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,359
which is kind of illegal.

101
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:35,779
And what happened here was that Mojang was forcing everyone to migrate

102
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,119
saying things like, "You will not be able to access the game.

103
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,219
Migration is mandatory.

104
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:40,159
Won't be able to play Minecraft.

105
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,615
Must be migrated to a Microsoft.

106
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:43,159
" Players need to move to a Microsoft account.

107
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,899
Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts.

108
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,719
Where funnily enough, they had the balls to say that this was voluntary three times.

109
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:51,039
So voluntary, in fact, that if you didn't do it

110
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,299
they took away what you paid for.

111
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:55,699
This was a forced migration, where we obviously didn't have much of a choice.

112
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,079
The only choice you had was to terminate your account.

113
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,009
And not only were they forcing everyone to give-.

114
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:00,059
..

115
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,979
their data to a company with a world record of privacy violations

116
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:08,019
which got recently fined $20 million by the FTC for illegally collecting information on children

117
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,939
most Minecraft players are children.

118
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,399
But in doing so, they also forced you to agree to Microsoft and Xbox's legal agreements

119
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,299
all under the threat of them taking away what you paid for if you didn't do what they wanted.

120
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,959
A contract needs to, uh, be entered into freely

121
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,079
and that obviously means that you need to have a

122
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,459
a choice between agreeing or not agreeing.

123
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:28,179
Just presenting one choice is not really, uh

124
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,100
an agreement.

125
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,559
But even though it was illegal, Mojang still went ahead with it

126
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,700
which resulted in millions of people losing access to what they paid for

127
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,700
some of which were never even notified that it was happening to begin with

128
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,020
only finding out years later that their purchase had been nullified.

129
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,079
But when actually contacting Mojang to complain, you'd come to find that they wouldn't answer questions

130
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,039
and automatically close most tickets asking for answers.

131
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,247
And when asking Microsoft about it, they would say that.

132
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:50,299
..

133
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:56,575
"I've discussed your issue with Mojang support and came to the conclusion that the migration is within the Minecraft Terms and Conditions.

134
00:06:56,575 --> 00:06:59,773
" In other words, "We've investigated ourselves and found nothing wrong.

135
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:02,219
" But unfortunately for them, this user knows his rights.

136
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:07,159
And when asking Microsoft to cite his contract for where it says that a Microsoft account is required to play

137
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:10,579
Microsoft said, "End User License Agreements are constantly updated.

138
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,279
Please refer to the current one," where the current one says

139
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,539
"If you originally signed up through a Mojang account

140
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,873
you must migrate to a Microsoft account in order to keep using the services.

141
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:21,839
" But this wasn't part of the contract when the user had bought the game

142
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,319
to which Microsoft replied, "I understand that this is your interpretation

143
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,049
but this EULA applies for any user regardless of the date of creation

144
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,319
" further stating that, "Your contract is the new EULA.

145
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,759
The old one doesn't apply anymore.

146
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,876
You agreed to these Terms by using the service.

147
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:36,779
" Where they then immediately closed the ticket

148
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,979
refusing to answer any further questions.

149
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,259
And this is a perfect example of fucking up in writing

150
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,816
because it confirms the idea that.

151
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:43,879
..

152
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,299
It is up to you to check back to see if these guidelines have changed.

153
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:52,619
And that they don't care about agreement, since they claim that you agreed to changes that they didn't even tell you about.

154
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:56,359
So Mojang voided everyone's contract since they say that they don't apply anymore.

155
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:59,039
And you fucking guessed it, this is breach of contract.

156
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,479
And if that wasn't bad enough, when actually looking at the historical changes to the contracts

157
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,979
there used to be a clause that says that you will be able to play the game even if you don't agree to the new changes

158
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,619
all of which were, of course, sneakily removed during the migration.

159
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:14,379
I would say that this, uh, forceful way of

160
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:19,139
um, migrating the customers is not a term that is enforceable by Microsoft

161
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,799
which in this case would mean that they would be forced to reinstate the old accounts.

162
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,919
And all of this is essentially what the class action lawsuit is about.

163
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,719
Minecraft's success is entirely due to the community making it what it is

164
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:33,999
through, for example, mods and servers, because the base game in itself isn't really that interesting.

165
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:40,318
And when the very things that we depend on to actually enjoy the game are being threatened by a company that ignores our rights like this

166
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:45,119
we as consumers end up being affected because Mojang is restricting the way we're able to play the game.

167
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:50,259
On top of them literally taking the game away under threat simply because they knew that nobody would be fighting back.

168
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:54,599
But there's a limit to the amount of shit that people are willing to take before taking measures.

169
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:55,399
And Mojang?

170
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,039
You fucking crossed it, because we're not begging or asking for mercy anymore.

171
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,339
This is a class action lawsuit that you cannot ignore.

172
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,119
I think this is an important, uh

173
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:08,579
case for this reason that this is becoming a general business practice right now

174
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:11,779
and it's not supposed to be like that when you're dealing with consumers

175
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:12,639
especially children.

176
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:20,419
We are seeing a lot of companies coming out with this claim that you don't get the full terms of service or for their product when you buy it.

177
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:23,119
The company you're buying from refer you to their

178
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:26,719
uh, contractual terms on the website, which can change at any time

179
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:29,739
basically depriving you all your consumer rights.

180
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:30,819
And this is not right.

181
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,979
This is something really needed to, uh

182
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:36,899
act upon and make sure that we can exer- exercise our consumer rights.

183
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,739
And our objectives are quite simple.

184
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:46,559
Revert the account migration, meaning the reinstatement of all unmigrated accounts where Mojang in the EU has to be the owner of all customer data

185
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,419
comply with contract and consumer protection laws, so notify about the changes

186
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:54,019
get agreement for the changes without threatening a consequence for disagreement

187
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:58,099
remove unenforceable clauses, including hidden clauses like the one that allows gambling

188
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:02,979
clearly indicate when changes happen, and comply with the terms of our old contracts.

189
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:06,439
I think these goals are re- both reasonable and achievable

190
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,659
and saying that is coming from looking at what this case is all about

191
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:17,439
which is, uh, a big corporation abusing consumer rights and doing so without anybody responding to it would be wrong.

192
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:20,519
But as you might have expected, the legal system is kind of complicated

193
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,119
because if we take these two examples, even though the core of the issue is the same

194
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:27,019
our contracts, there's a difference in who was affected by them.

195
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,259
Basically, you need to have the same kind of damage and the same kind of circumstances for everybody that

196
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:33,819
uh, goes into the class action.

197
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:36,859
So they would each have a different way of approaching it legally

198
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:41,339
some being easier to pursue than others, which is why the account migration is such a great option

199
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,559
because you paid for something which they then took from you under threat

200
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,339
all of which is very easily quantifiable damages

201
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:53,439
which basically affected everyone before 2023, including those who did migrate because it was done under threat.

202
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:56,039
And since the account migration is tied to our contracts

203
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,199
just like everything else, we can then use it to resolve most issues with a single process.

204
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:03,819
We need to decide on how we formulate this claim.

205
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:07,319
What is the damage that's been done and how are we going to prove that?

206
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:11,019
And, uh, actually the evidence is gonna decide for us how we're gonna do this.

207
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:12,579
And that is the reason for this video

208
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,579
because we are now at the stage where we need you

209
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:18,219
the Minecraft player, to say that you want to participate in the class action lawsuit

210
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:22,999
and to tell us how you were affected so that we can then identify and form the group that will participate.

211
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:29,459
And the more submissions we get, the more likely we are to achieve what we've set out to do and show Mojang that they don't get to do whatever the fuck they want.

212
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:36,599
Obviously, it's always decided on the evidence and how well we can present that to a court and make them understand what's actually at stake here

213
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:41,299
which is the consumer's, uh, right to actually resist being abused by a big company.

214
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,359
Where the first thing I want to say is thank you

215
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:49,719
because it's thanks to those donations that we now actually have a chance to fight back in a way that's never really been done before

216
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,879
and if we win, Mojang will also have to pay back our legal costs

217
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,159
which also unfortunately goes the other way, meaning that I would essentially go bankrupt if we were to lose

218
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,979
which is always a possibility.

219
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:05,019
But I don't want to live with the regret of not trying simply because I was too afraid of losing.

220
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:06,099
So bring it on, Mojang.

221
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,639
I'll see you in court.

222
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,539
 And even though it feels a little bit wrong to mention it

223
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:18,019
we are fighting a billion-dollar corporation that can shit out money faster than privacy violations.

224
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:20,339
If you do feel like supporting what we're doing

225
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,279
the GoFundMe still exists.
