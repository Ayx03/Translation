1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,699
Feeling out of place in this place right now

2
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:12,660
Everything has changed for the worse

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,460
Somehow everyone's off the face and I'm the odd one out

4
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:23,359
The DJ isn't great and the music's loud

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,100
I would rather be in my bed sleeping

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,918
Than deal with all these people

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,119
One shot two shot three shot four, all my friends are on the floor

8
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,600
I can't do this anymore

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,119
I should have stayed at home these days

10
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,659
Don't feel the shed

11
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:49,119
Everyone's on coca***

12
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,380
I swear I hate this place

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,240

Someone put me out of my misery

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,179
Feel like everyone here is judging me

19
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,079
How do you call this fun

20
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:15,400
Oh

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,239
It's a mystery

22
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,259
Call it what you want just stop calling me

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,719
I would rather be in my bed sleeping

24
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,060
Than deal with all these people

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,500
One shot two shot three shot four
