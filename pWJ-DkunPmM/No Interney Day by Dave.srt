1
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:14,008
Let me tell you this horrible story

2
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:18,857
About that time I was left by my one and only

3
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:21,553
I was searching, I was browsing

4
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:24,217
With no results to show

5
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:26,559
Our love was broad, but now I'm band

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,716
Baby where did you go?

7
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:34,197
Oh Internet, I need you, miss you

8
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:36,699
Internet, alone without you

9
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:41,104
Internet, I just keep on searching, searching

10
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:44,071
Oh Internet, I need you, miss you

11
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:46,503
Internet, alone without you

12
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:49,968
Internet, I just keep on searching

13
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:56,366
With no results showing

14
00:00:56,366 --> 00:01:00,983
www.please.comhome

15
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:03,057
We both love lots of cookies

16
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:06,047
Without you I am alone

17
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:07,661
How will I still cope?

18
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:10,730
I need you more than ever

19
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,819
You managed all my money

20
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:18,286
And we shopped together

21
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,757
Oh Internet, I need you, miss you

22
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:23,255
Internet, alone without you

23
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:27,884
Internet, I just keep on searching, searching

24
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:30,580
Oh Internet, I need you, miss you

25
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,034
Internet, alone without you

26
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:36,393
Internet, I just keep on searching

27
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:44,748
With no results showing

28
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:51,936
Wait a minute, what is this feeling?

29
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:54,469
No pings, notifications

30
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:58,619
Or reminders of a world that is not

31
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,511
That great to be in

32
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:03,440
I feel free

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,903
The Internet has ceased

34
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:10,814
Is that what it takes to find this peace?

35
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:15,906
Ooh, wait a minute

36
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:20,951
What is this feeling?

37
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:26,926
I've missed this feeling

38
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:29,420
Oh Internet, I thought I'd miss you

39
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,853
Internet, but life without you

40
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:36,418
Internet, It's almost refreshing, freshing

41
00:02:36,418 --> 00:02:39,296
Oh Internet, I thought I'd miss you

42
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:41,697
Internet, I'm fine without you

43
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:45,350
Internet, thanks for all that you've done

44
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,832
But now I must move on

45
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:54,832
Oh Internet
